**Jellystat-UI** is the Web UI for Jellystat

`Notice`
Jellystat is splitting from a mono repo to allow for more flexibility in devlopment between the UI and API. The UI repo can be found here. [Jellystat UI repo](https://github.com/CyferShepard/Jellystat-UI)

## Getting Started with Development

- Clone the project from git
- Set your env variables before starting the server (Variable names as per [Environmental Variables](#environmental-variables) above).
- Run `npm install` to install necessary packages
- Run `npm run build` to build local files in production
- Run `npm run dev` to run the client as developer
- if you require `env.js` this file is built by Jellystat API to pass-through docker variables to the frontend

For API Development, checkout the [Jellystat repo](https://github.com/CyferShepard/Jellystat)
